# Tuning and spinup of NorESM3

## Introduction

<!--
This little guide demonstrates how to turn any [Github](http://github.com) repository with a bunch of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files into a simple website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

* You don't need to use the command line or anything other than your browser.
* It doesn't require any knowledge in Jekyll.
* It's completely compatible with any bunch of markdown files you already have in any existing repository without any modification to those files. That includes the basic `README.md` almost all repositories contain.
* The markdown files will remain just as readable and usable in Github than in your website.
-->

In fact this guide uses the same configuration and can be read both in Github and in Github Pages, at your preference:
